# OOP cont'd

- Four pillars of OOP

## Encapsulation

- Technique of keeping internal state of object hidden from the outside
- Achieved using private attributes and providing public methods to acess and update them
- Syntax: \_\_varname

## Abstraction

- Concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object
- Achieved by using abstract class and method

### Abstraction Class and Method

- ......... look at his repo after class?

## Inheritance

- Mechanism of creating a new class based on an existing class, by inheriting properties (attributes and/or methods)
- Parent class: from where the features are inherited
- Child class: inherits the features
- Benefits: Classes are created easily, easy maintenance


## Polymorphism

- Ability to present the same interface for different data types
- Allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon
